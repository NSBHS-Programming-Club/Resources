# What is Clojure?

**Clojure** is a programming language that is **general-purpose** - it can be used in anything from making apps to web design.

It was originally built off of another language that's really big - **Java**, which is used on desktops to make a lot of things already, from games (e.g. Minecraft) to apps. However, it has since spread to web design with a variant, **ClojureScript**, which is built off of **JavaScript**, the "backbone" of making websites.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to program in Clojure, and make some cool things in the process! Let's get going, shall we?
